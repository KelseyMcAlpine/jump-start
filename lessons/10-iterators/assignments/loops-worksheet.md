# Loops Worksheet

Read the code in each section, then write exactly what the code prints out. Use a loop table to help you track each variable for each iteration.

Each problem stands alone. Variables from previous problems do not exist.

*Example:*
```
x = 5
y = 6
print(x+y) #=> 11
```

```

6.
```ruby
(1..5).each do
  puts "hello!"
end
# => hello!
# => hello!
# => hello!
# => hello!
# => hello!
```

7.
```ruby
(1..3).each do |i|
  puts "#{i} animals(s)"
end
# => 1 animal(s)
# => 2 animal(s)
# => 3 animal(s)
```

8.
```ruby
(1..3).each do |i|
  puts i * i
end
# => 1
# => 4
# => 9
```

9.
```ruby
total = 0

(1..3).each do |i|
  total = total + i
end

puts total
# => 6
```

10.
```ruby
(1..10).each do |x|
  if x == 5
    puts "You got a winner!"
  end
end
# => "You got a winner!"
```

11.
```ruby
i = 0

while i < 3
  puts "hi"
  i = i + 1
end
# => hi
# => hi
# => hi
```

12.
```ruby
i = 0

while i < 3
  puts "hi"
  i = i + 1
end

puts "bye"
# => hi
# => hi
# => hi
# => bye
```

13.
```ruby
i = 0

while i < 3
  i += 1
  puts i
end
# => 1
# => 2
# => 3
```

14.
```ruby
x = 5
i = 0

while i < 3
  x = x + 1
  i = i + 1
end

puts x
# => 8
```

15.
```ruby
i = 3

while i > 0
  puts "ada!"
  i = i - 1
end
# => ada!
# => ada!
# => ada!
```

16.
```ruby
i = 1

while i
  puts "a while"
end
# => this would print "a while" forever! It's an infinite loop
```

17.
```ruby
i = 1

while i < 100
  puts "o hai"
  i = i * 100
end
# => o hai
```
