## Objectives
### Vocabulary
  + **Blocks** — A block is a piece of code that is not executed immediately. Instead, it is stored in a variable or passed to a method as a parameter to be potentially executed at a later time.
  + **Loops** — Loops are programming constructs that help you repeat a code action an arbitrary number of times without copying and pasting the code. Another term for a loop is iteration.
  + **Iterator** — An Iterator is a method that allows you to loop through all the members of a collection. It works like "for" or "while" but without any extra language keywords.
  + **Iteration** — Another term for loops.
  + **Iteration Variable** —  Denoted between two vertical bars `|` and is used to store data associated with the iteration.
  + **Counter-Controlled** — Used when the number of loops can be determined prior to loop execution.
  + **Sentinel-Controlled** — Used when the number of loops cannot be determined prior to loop execution.
  + **Loop Table** — 
  + **Times Loop** — You use the times iterator to run a block of code N times.
  + **Range** — Ranges express a sequence. Sequences have a start point, an end point, and a way to produce successive values in the sequence. Ruby creates these sequences using the `..` and `...` range operators. The two-dot form creates an inclusive range, while the three-dot form creates a range that excludes the specified high value.
  + **While Loop** — The while loop is useful when you want to continue doing an action while a certain condition is true but you may not know how many times you'll need to complete that action. As soon as the condition stops being true, the loop will terminate.
  + **Until Loop** — The inverse of the while loop. The loop will execute until the condition evaluates as true.

### Know the purpose for iteration in creating programs
Iteration allows your to write code that is executed repeatedly, but avoids code duplication and repetition. It also allows you to repeatedly run the code until a specific goal has been achieved.

### Write loops in order to prevent code duplication and repetition
I used loops in my [Election Time Assignment](assignments/mcalpine-election.rb) to avoid being repetitive.

### Understand how a loop will execute the statements inside and what the resulting output will be
