# Learning Style

##Objectives

### Explore your learning style
Of the VARK learning styles, I relate most to being a read/write learner. Because of this, I prefer to read through and review new information prior learning it in a classroom. I find this allows me time to digest the information, and allows me to use in-class time to ask questions and get help. I also consider myself to be a kinesthetic learner. I'm eager to understand how something works in the real world, so I find experience and practice to be a key part of my personal learning process. 

### Find strategies that allow you to consume information quickly and with retention
I use these strategies to consume and retain new information:
  + Making lists of new terms
  + Connecting a concept to how it could be applied/used in real life
  + Avoiding distractions with laser sharp focus!

### Find strategies that help you increase your understanding of material
These are strategies I've found to be the most helpful in increasing my understanding of material:
  + Re-reading my notes after class
  + Re-wording and re-writing my notes
  + Writing a simple example of code after learning new concepts
  + Working through samples/exercises that reinforce a skill I'm still learning 
  + Forming study groups

### Find strategies for checking your understanding of material
To check for understanding, I typically do the following:
  + Test myself using flashcards
  + Utilize my classmates by quizzing each other
  + Explain how something works to someone else
  + Read through a sample of code and try to predict the results
