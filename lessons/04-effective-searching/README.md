## Assignment
- [X] [Assignment: Google Lessons](assignments/google-lessons.md)

## Objectives
### Vocabulary
  + **Stackoverflow** — Q&A site for programmers
  + **RubyDocs** – Help and documentation specifically for Ruby
  
### To know which source to look to for an answer
### To be able to evaluate a source as likely to have the answer you are looking for (or not)
### To be able to narrow your search results to yield better results
Some of the tips I've found that help narrow search results include:
  + Using keywords rather than full sentences
  + Adding the word 'example' to see an example
  + Adding the specific language you are coding, e.g. 'ruby'
  + Using double quotations to find an exact match
  + Using "type:" to narrow answers down by extension
  + Trying code snippets in a safe place first
  + Using a hyphen to exclude words i.e. mustang –cars
  + Using a colon to search specific sites i.e. Lebron site:espn.com
  + Using “link:” to find a page that links to another page i.e. link:nytimes.com
  + Using the asterisk wildcard to automatically fill in text in i.e. “Come * right now * me” should find The Beatles song
  + Using “related:” to find sites similar to other sites
  + Using OR to search for multiple words at once i.e. chocolate OR white chocolate
  + Searchomg a range of numbers by using “..”

### To find answers to a question on your own
