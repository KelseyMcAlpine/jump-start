## Objectives
### Vocabulary
  + **Algorithm** — An algorithm is a set of steps for a computer to accomplish a task. A good algorithm is precise and efficient.
      - **Essential Properties of an Algorithm**
        - *Finiteness* — An algorithm must start and stop. The rules an algorithm applies must also conclude in a reasonable amount of time. What "reasonable" is depends on the nature of the algorithm, but in no case can an algorithm take an infinite amount of time to complete its task.
        - *Definiteness* — The actions that an algorithm performs cannot be open to multiple interpretations; each step must be precise and unambiguous.
        - *Inputs* — An algorithm starts its computation from an initial state. This state may be expressed as input values given to the algorithm before it starts.
        - *Outputs* — An algorithm must produce a result with a specific relation to the inputs.
        - *Effectiveness* — The steps an algorithm takes must be sufficiently simple that they could be expressed "on paper"; these steps must make sense for the quantities used.
      - **Steps of an Algorithm**
        - Writing an algorithm
        - Testing an algorithm
        - Refining (or refactoring) an algorithm
        - Evaluating an algorithm
  + **Input** — An input is an initial state that the algorithm starts from. 
  + **Output** — The output is the result of the algorithm.

### Create a precise set of instructions
1. The first step in making a delicious PB&J is to gather your ingredients, and place them on the counter. You will need these ingredients as well as a knife:
  + Sliced bread
  + Peanut Butter 
  + Jelly
2. If the bread bag is closed, you will need to open it. If it is already open, go to the next step.
3. Remove two pieces of bread, and place them on the counter next to each other on the counter.
4. Open the peanut butter. If the jar is already open, go to the next step.
5. Pick up the knife and scoop out roughly 2 tablespoons of peanut butter from the jar.
6. Spread peanut butter on the left slice of bread until the surface is covered.
7. Repeat step 5.
8. Spread peanut butter on the right slice of bread until the surface is covered.
9. Wipe excess peanut butter from the knife.
10. Open the jar of jelly. If the jar is already open, go to the next step.
11. Use the knife to scoop out roughly 2 tablespoons of jelly from the jar.
12. Spread jelly on one of the slices of bread until the surface is covered.
13. Pick up the slice of bread coated in only peanut butter, and place it peanut-butter side down on top of the other slice of bread.
14. Enjoy your delicious creation!!

### Test an algorithm for correctness
I tested my algorithm for accuracy using a friend as my guinea pig!  

### Refine an algorithm to be more clear
During the test of my algorithm, I realized that I needed to be much more specific. My step 3 initially said, "Remove two pieces of bread, and place them on the counter." After testing the algorithm, I realized that this wasn't as specific as it needed to be, so I revised it. I had a similar realization with the steps that instructed my friend to scoop out peanut butter and jelly. They have since ben modified to include a more specific amount (2 tablespoons each time).

### Evaluate an algorithm as finite and correct in solving a specified problem
Once I revised my algorithm, I tested it once again and found that it worked! YAY!
