## Objectives
### Vocabulary
  + **Terminal** — The program used to navigate through and modify your files and folders (also called directories)
  + **Command line** — The actual line in the console where you type a command. The command line works by displays a single line of text (*prompt*), which accepts a single line of text (*command*). When commands are entered, it (*executes*) them and displays the (*output*) or result of the executed commands.
  + **Commands** – Actions that we ask the computer to make using a single line of text

### To know advantages of the command line and why programmers use it
Command line is faster and more efficient than using a window.

### To utilize the terminal to navigate, create, delete, and modify files and folders
Running a command to complete any of these tasks in the terminal uses the following syntax: [Command] [Options] [Arguments] 
There are also special paths (used to navigate within the terminal):
  
  + Home directory — "~" 
  + Current directory — "." 
  + Parent directory — ".." 
  + Can be chained together, this goes up two directories — "../../" 
  + Previous directory — "-" 

### To know and utilize basic terminal commands
Below are the basic terminal commands:
  + **ls** — List directory (display all of the child files and directories for the current location)
  + **cd** — Change directory (move to a different location, all further commands execute at that location)
  + **touch** — Create new file or update timestamp of existing file: If the file argument does not exist, create it as an empty file. If the file argument does exist, 'touch' it's timestamp (last modified date/time) to be the current date/time.
  + **mkdir** — Make eirectory (create a new directory with the name specified)
  + **rm** — Remove (delete the file or folder passed to rm)
  + **mv** — Move (move argument1 to argument2 (removes argument1). This is like renaming.)
  + **cp** — Copy (copy argument1 to argument2)
  + **man** — Manual (open the manual for a specific command ('q' to quit out of manual mode))
  + **pwd** — Present Working Directory (display the current location as a "path" (sequence of child directories separated by /) starting with the root directory)
  + **whoami** — Tells you what user you are currently working as
  + **cat** — Print the contents of the argument to the screen (no scrolling)
