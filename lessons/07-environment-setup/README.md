# Environment Setup

## Assignment
- [X] [Installfest](notes/what-even-is-ruby.md)

## Objectives
### Vocabulary
  + **Ruby** — A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
  + **irb** — irb stands for interactive Ruby. It's a computer program that allows the user to enter Ruby code and get back the results of that code immediately. These kinds of programs are great for trying out new commands, practicing syntax, and evaluating solutions to small problems. In the next lesson, we will use irb to write and execute our first program!
  + **Text Editor** — A computer program that allows you to create and edit files that contain plain text
  + **Package Manager** — A collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.

### To understand the role of and then setup a development environment
A development environment is the set of processes and programming tools used to create a program or software. 

### To understand the function of _ruby_ vs _irb_
Ruby is a programming language, whereas irb (short for interactive ruby) allows a user to enter Ruby code and get back the results of that code immediately. It's useful when trying out new commands, practicing syntax, and evaluating solutions to small problems.

### To understand the purpose of a text editor (like _atom_)
Text Editors are programs geared towards making code generation easier.
  
### To meet our first _package manager_
The first package manager I'll be using is [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/)!
