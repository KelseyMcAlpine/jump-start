# The Big Picture

## Objectives
### Vocabulary
  + **Programming Languages** — A formal computer language or constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine/computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. Programming languages are classified as: 
    + **Low Level || High Level** (how close to binary code the language is)
      + *Low Level* — more difficult to read (closer to binary)
      + *High Level* — easier to read (further from binary)
    + **Compiled || Interpreted**
      + *Compiled* — converted to binary code
      + *Interpreted* — can be translated or directly executed, meaning the code does not get directly converted to binary (the program that runs the program is the one that communicates with the computer). This extra step makes these languages slower.
    + **Statically Typed || Dynamically Typed**
      + *Statically Typed* — A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time.
      + *Dynamically Typed* — A language is dynamically typed if the type of a variable is interpreted at runtime. 
  + **HTML** — Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language. The "skeleton" of a web page, forming the set up and structure for how each piece is organized.
  + **CSS** — Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language. Responsible for wow each piece looks (including colors, sizes, styles and relationship to other elements on the page).
  + **JS** — JavaScript is a dynamically typed and interpreted programming language. It's used with HTML and CSS as one of the most important languages in web programming and provides a more dynamic and responsive experience for the end user.
  + **Ruby** — High Level, Interpreted, dynamically-typed language.  
  + **Rails (Ruby on Rails)** —  A Model-View Controller (MVC) Framework that allows developers to create an entire web application without having to rely on someone else to create part of it for you.
  + **Frameworks** — A universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products, and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or solution.
    + Improves the efficiency of creating new software.
    + Improve developer productivity as well as the quality, reliability and robustness of new software.

### To have a high level understanding in how these technologies are used in combination to create a web app
