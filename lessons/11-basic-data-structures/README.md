## Objectives
### Vocabulary 
  + **Data Structure** —
  + **Array** — An ordered collection of objects.
  + **Index** — Arrays are integer-indexed starting at zero. This means that each item in the array corresponds to an integer value, and that integer is used to access an object within the Array. The first object is assigned 0 and increments up from there.
  + **Value** —
  + **Hash** — A collection type similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via unordered keys of any object type, and not an ordered integer index. A hash is a collection of key-value pairs.
  + **Key-Value Pair** —
  + **Default Value** —

### To understand what a data structure is and how it can be used

### To be able to create a new array and hash data structure

### To be able to access data in an array and hash

### To be able to add data to an array and hash

### To understand the difference between an array and a hash
The difference between an array and a hash is how they are indexed. An array is indexed by integer values starting at 0, whereas a hash 

### To know the syntax needed to create a new array and hash
Syntax for creating a new array
`my_array =()`

Syntax for creating a new hash
`my_hash = {}`
